        <h2>Corporate Leadership</h2>
        <h3>Peter Pan <small>Chief Epicurious Officer</small></h3>
        <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Our CEO, Peter, credits his hardworking East Asian immigrant
            parents who
            undertook the arduous
            journey to the shores of America with the intention of giving their children the best
            future. His
            mother's wizardy in the kitchen whipping up the tastiest dishes with whatever is available
            inexpensively at the supermarket, was his first inspiration to create the fusion cuisines
            for which
            <em>The Frying Pan</em> became well known. He brings his zeal for fusion cuisines to this
            restaurant, pioneering cross-cultural culinary connections.</p>

        <h3>Dhanasekaran Witherspoon <small>Chief Food Officer</small></h3>
        <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Our CFO, Danny, as he is affectionately referred to by his
            colleagues,
            comes from a long established
            family tradition in farming and produce. His experiences growing up on a farm in the
            Australian
            outback gave him great appreciation for varieties of food sources. As he puts it in his own
            words,
            <em>Everything that runs, wins, and everything that stays, pays!</em></p>

        <h3>Agumbe Tang <small>Chief Taste Officer</small></h3>
        <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Blessed with the most discerning gustatory sense, Agumbe, our CTO,
            personally ensures that every dish
            that we serve meets his exacting tastes. Our chefs dread the tongue lashing that ensues if
            their
            dish does not meet his exacting standards. He lives by his motto, <em>You click only if you
                survive
                my lick.</em></p>
